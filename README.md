# Movie SQL Database 431-Project
Our unique movie database is designed to be displayed using a website or an app. It features an actor table containing actors' first names, last name, actor ID for the movies they are in, their ages, and their genders. There may be duplicate actors in multiple movies because they are the same. We also have a director table that lists the director's first name, last name, actor ID, age, and gender. We also have a genre table that lists multiple genre names and their IDs. Lastly, we have a movie table that lists each movie's duration, title, genre, rating out of 10 from IMDB, release date, and movie ID. 

Our team is utilizing SQL and a PHP server for this project. We've seamlessly imported our SQL data into the MySQL workbench from the PHP server. In our Visual Studio code, we've established a connection with the MySQL server using the username, hostname, password, and database name to retrieve our information. We've leveraged HTML for the creation of our webpage, PHP to connect the data, CSS to format the page, and SQL for select queries to display on the webpage, showcasing our technical prowess.

We value your input and hope you find our website enjoyable. The user interface of our website is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing you to easily search for movies, view actor and director profiles, and explore different genres. Please take a moment to share your thoughts by submitting your poll at the end of your visit. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us understand your preferences and the type of films you are into.
