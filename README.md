# Movie SQL Database 431-Project
Our idea is to make a movie database that can be displayed using a website or an app. In our case, our movie database has an actor table containing actors' first names, last name, actor ID for the movies they are in, their ages, and their genders. There may be duplicate actors in multiple movies due to their being the same actors. We also have a director table that lists the director's first name, last name, actor ID, age, and gender. We also have a genre table that lists multiple genre names and their IDs. Lastly, we have a movie table that lists each movie's duration, title, genre, rating out of 5, release date, and movie ID. 

We are doing our project in SQL using a php server. From the php server, we imported our SQL data into MySQLWorkbench. In our visual studio code, we connected the MySQL server from the username, host name, password, and name of the database we are grabbing our information from. In visual studio code we used HTML for the creation of our webpage, php to connect the databse, CSS to format the page, SQL for select query's to display in the webpage and Java.

Our project is still a work in progress, and we hope to have more progress soon! üòÅ
