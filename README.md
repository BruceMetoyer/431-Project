# 431-Project
Our idea is to make a movie database that can be displayed using a website or an app. In our case, our movie database has an actor table containing actors' first names, last name, actor ID for the movies they are in, their ages, and their genders. There may be duplicate actors in multiple movies due to their being the same actors. We also have a director table that lists the director's first name, last name, actor ID, age, and gender. We also have a genre table that lists multiple genre names and their IDs. Lastly, we have a movie table that lists each movie's duration, title, genre, rating out of 5, release date, and movie ID. 

We are doing our project in SQL using a php server. From the php server, we imported the data into visual studio code where we can then make an app or website. We are considering making a website using HTML but also have other ideas with react or swift. 

Our project is still a work in progress, and we hope to have more progress soon! üòÅ
